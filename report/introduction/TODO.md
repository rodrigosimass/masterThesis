[x] switch section "input and output vectors" with "performance assessment"
[X] mention that vectors can be interpreted as neuron activity
[X] mention that activity in the brain is sparse
[X] mention the challenge of real world data not being sparse in the vectors' section
[ ] compare the storage capacity of listing memories with associative memories.
[ ] mention that in the Willshaw, 1 weight is 1 bit
[ ] Willshaw is better at completion, not so good at noise removal. Sparse codes assume that all the information is paramount. noise is very bad for the WN.
[ ] WN can be extended to non binary (frequency instead of 0 and 1) weights and store much more.
[x] MNIST figure that shows density of pixel usage.
[X] mention how in V1 we also have a biological sparse coding strategy with receptors for specific lines and orientations
[X] mention that dense representations use much less bits. but sparse representations can be stored in adequate data structures, reference upcoming section on implementation efficiency.
[ ] the fact that real world data is not an SDR is mentioned first in section 1.3 but then is also mentioned in 2.something,make it only one section.
[X] put Willshaw Network section before input vectors
[X] explain how random sparse data is perfect for AMs, but real world data is the oposite.
[] mention how most results on AMs are on random sparse data, which makes the results missleading 
[] mention that AEs can do the same as PCA if they are very simple
[X] mention where are AEs useful: denoising and low dimension visualization
[] section about Luis' codes feels like it needs some closing thoughts
[] Distinguish between generation and decompression (auto encoders)
[X] Talk about GANs
[] Maybe mention that we can also solve the hard integral of the posterior with stochastic methods such as Gibbs sampling/ Monte Carlo

ABSTRACT:
[X] maybe mention that Luis codes are inspired by the mammalian visual cortex.

FINAL WEEK:
[X] Cut the Abstract in half.
[ ] Explain what i cut of from the abstract in the introduction and conclusion.
[ ] Add concrete evaluation methods (in the conclusion)
[ ] Start the body with Biology
[ ] Conclusion
[ ] GANs as evaluation method
[ ] Call Luis' codes What Where codes consistently in the whole document.
[ ] Change the name of section "Vectors" to "patterns" or "codes"
[ ] Change encoding function to "Encoding Prescription" on entire document
[ ] Decide on using "I" or "we" and make it consistent throughout the document
